	 * to the server. The server should output the message back to all connected clients
	 * (you should see your own message pop up in your client as well when you send it!).
	 *  We will build on this project in the future to make a full fledged server based game,
	 *  so make sure you can read your code later! Use good programming practices.
	 *  ****HINT**** you may wish to have a thread be in charge of sending information 
	 *  and another thread in charge of receiving information.
